# Cloudflare DNS configuration just became amazingly easy!


## How to use it right now!
- Click the `Use this template` button at the top of this repo.
- add rest of instructions
- probably some API setup
- get tokens https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens/create https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
- Click `Create Token`.
- On `Edit zone DNS`, click `Use template`.
- Edit the token name on top, maybe something like `github-dns-records`
- Edit the `Zone Resources` to include a specific zone, or zones of an account, or all zones.
- Click `Continue to summary`.
- Verify things looks right, and click `Create Token`.
- Copy the generated token and save it (or put it on github for actions somewhere)???????????
